					We are the chosen. In each family there is one who seems to be called to 
					find our roots, our ancestors. To put flesh to their bones and make them 
					live again. To tell the family story and to feel that somehow they know and 
					approve. Genealogy research is not a cold gathering of facts but, instead, 
					it is an indeaver to breath life into all those's who have gone before us. 
					We are the story tellers of the family. All familys have one. We have been 
					called, as it were, by our genes. Those who have gone before cry out to us: 
					Tell our story. So, we do. In finding them, we somehow find ourselves. How 
					many graves have I stood before now and cried? I have lost count. How many 
					times have I told my ancestors, 'You have a wonderful family. You would be 
					proud of us.' How many times have I walked up to a grave and felt somehow 
					there was love there for me? I cannot say. It goes beyond just documenting 
					facts. It goes to who I am, and why I do the things I do. It goes to seeing 
					a cemetery about to be lost forever to weeds and indifference and 
					saying - I can't let this happen. I must do something, and this is what I do.<br></p>					
					<p style="text-align: justify;">
					This Page will lead you to some of the family photo's that have been taken 
					through the years. I have tried to restore some of the older photos when 
					possible. And I am trying to sort though the thousands of photos that I have 
					scattered over seven hard drives. Most of the pictures are black &amp; white. 
					Color photos came out in the 1890's. But color was not readily available to 
				    the general public until around the early 1940's. </p></td>
