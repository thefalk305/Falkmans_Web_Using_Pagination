<p> Welcome to Arbr√•, Sweden. It is here that Corine
Noren was born on the out skirts of Arbr√•. A little east of town center. The Local area was known 
as "Koldamo". Arbr√• itself is located about 15 Km (about 9.3 miles) north of Ballnas, and 5 Km 
(about 3.1 miles) south of Vallsta, along the Ljusnan River. Her home was an old, rather large 
structure. Probably built by her grandfather. And each succeeding generation lived in it. As was 
the custom in those times (17<sup>th</sup> to 18<sup>th</sup> century). And not migrating, 
hither and thither, as was done in the large cities. The homestead was near a large wood. With a 
small inland lake and wood.</p>

<b>This is a tipical Homestead (farm) around Arbr√•</b>

<p>Corine's mother, G√∂lin Pehrsdotter, died
when Corine was about a year old. Corine was the youngest of 3 sisters. Of necessity, it was 
not long before there was a stepmother installed in the house. Corine's stepmother's name was 
Stina Sjon Andersdotter. After which there came several more childres. Her stepmother was a 
good and kind mother to all the chrildren. And there was no cause for complaint from the older 
children.</p>

<p Karin's father was an intellectual man. 
He became a lay preacher. Starting a church, later to be nown as the Swedish Covenant Church. 
And had studied a great deal and wrote considerably. He and several of his parishioners erected 
a church for the town. Corine's father, Pehr Noren passed away when Karin was about 14 years 
old. From Arbr√•. Corine traveled to Hudiksvall. Presumably to learn a trade. (she was trained 
to be a seamstress). This is where she might have met Nils Peter (my great-grandfather). They 
were both in Hudiksvall durning the same period.</p>

<p Corine Nor√©n migrated to America in early
May of 1892. She left from G√∂teborg, the same as Nils.  She traveled on the SS Norden. Which 
took her to her first stop, Humburg, Germany. From Humburg she traveled by train to Breman. And 
from Breman, she boarded the SS Trave, a steamer that would take her to New York City, America. 
Upon her arrival she set off immediately for Du Bois Penn. And there she met up with Peter. And 
within several days of her arrival she was married. That would have been on the 25th of May 1892.</p>


<p></p>Arbr√•, located in H√§lsingland, Sweden, was part 
of a broader regional pattern of emigration during the 19th and early 20th centuries. 
While Arbr√• itself may not be widely documented in emigration studies, it fits into the 
larger story of rural Swedish communities sending thousands to North America.
<p >üåç<b>Why People Left Arbr√• and Similar Areas</b> Economic hardship:
Crop failures, limited farmland, and industrialization displaced many rural workers.
Religious and social pressures: The dominance of the Lutheran State Church and rigid 
class structures pushed people to seek freedom elsewhere. Population growth: Sweden‚Äôs 
population doubled between 1750 and 1850, straining resources.</p>
<p ></p>üö¢ <b>The Journey to America</b> Most emigrants from Arbr√• would have 
traveled to Gothenburg, then taken a feeder ship to Hull, England, followed by a train 
to Liverpool, and finally boarded a transatlantic liner to the U.S. The trip could take 
10 - 20 days, often in cramped steerage conditions.</p>
<p >üìç <b>Where They Settled</b>. Many Swedes from H√§lsingland ended up in 
Minnesota, Illinois, and Wisconsin, drawn by farming opportunities and established 
Swedish communities3. Some moved to urban centers like Chicago, working in construction 
or domestic service.</p>
