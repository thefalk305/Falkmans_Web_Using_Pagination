		<p>Peter Falkman Traveled to DuBois, Pa. shortly after arriving in New York City in 1891. The 
		reason for him traveling to DuBois was because he had a brother living in DuBois. And his name was 
		John Lofgren. John was some ten years older than Nils. And had traveled to America five or six
		years earlier. NIls waited in DuBois for Katherine Norin to arrive. And she did, the followning year.
		It wasn't long after her arrival that they decided to get married. They were married in the county
		court house on May 25<sup>th</sup>. And five days later they were married in the Augustana-Synoden 
		church. By Pastor J. M. Alexis. Those present at the cerimony were, his brother, John Lofgren and 
		a friend, Jonas Johnson. Nils Peter stayed in Du Bois for another year or so. Plying his trade as a 
		shoe maker. He worked hard. And saved what money he could. My grandfather, Herman Falkman, was born in DuBois. On Sept. 1<sup>st</sup>, 1893. 
		A short while after Herman was born Nils Peter and Katherine decided to leave Du Bois and travel 
		to Chicago, Illinois. I don't know exactly when. But Herman was still quit young. As for Nis Peter
		brother, John. He became homesick. And wanted to return to Sweden for a vacation. But on the
		voyage home John passed away. Never reaching Sweden or seeing his wife and children again. But that's 
		another branch of the family. And a story on it's own. Maybe if I have the time I will document 
		the Lofgren side of the family tree. It's very interesting.
		</p>

		<h2>History of DuBois</h2>
		<p>Where to start...well, lets start at the very beginning. In 1812, 
		George Shaffer became the first permanent inhabitant; in 1872, John Rumbarger, Jr. established 
		the town of Rumbarger, which later became the City of DuBois. John DuBois' built his wood mill in 
		1872. Then, in 1881, he built a box factory and brought the iron works from Williamsport to DuBois. 
		At one point, the City of DuBois was a town divided, because of a rivalry between the coal miners 
		of Rumbarger and the lumbermen of DuBois.  With the rapid building in the DuBois section, it soon
		overtook the Rumbarger section. In 1881, the town of DuBois organized as a borough divided into 
		three wards as a result of the quick growth. In 1883, McCrory's, a five-and-dime store, opened in 
		the Borough of DuBois and that store remained until it's closing in the 1980s. Also in 1883, the 
		first “drift” mine opened on a thousand-acre tract between DuBois and Falls Creek and the B.R.& P 
		Railroad arrived.Things were surely humming in the Borough of DuBois.</p> 
		<h2>The Fire of 1888</h2>

		<p>But, as we all know, what goes up must come down. So, on the fateful 
		day of June 18, 1888, fire broke out at John Baker’s Hotel near the railroad crossing on West 
		Long Avenue. Wind blew the fire toward Main Street, then switched directions and started up West 
		Long Avenue. It consumed everything in its path. Firefighters dynamited buildings trying to stop 
		the progress of the flames, which ultimately spread it even farther. Once the wind stopped, the 
		fire went out. To that end, it destroyed everything in its path that bordered Long Avenue, 
		Stockdale Street, East Scribner Avenue and beyond Main Street. The good things that came out of 
		the fire were no lives were lost and the DuBois Volunteer Fire Department was founded. On June 25, 
		1888, the first company was formed: Volunteer Second Ward. James Whithall became the first Fire 
		Chief. Additionally, the first Firemen's Parade was held in June 1893. Following the fire, the
		Borough of DuBois rose from the ashes and got to work. They rebuilt larger and sturdier buildings, 
		a new water system, and constructed a reservoir in upper Clear Run. Gas lines were also installed 
		and electricity ran for streetlights. Frank Hahne, Sr. started the DuBois Brewery in 1895, which 
		stayed in business through 1972. In 1896, the DuBois Traction Street Railroad Company organized 
		and rails were cut into the streets on the east side to Rumbarger Cemetery on South Main Street. 
		In due time, the increase of automobiles would signal the end of the street car in the City of DuBois.</p> 
		<h2>The Doctor's Hospital</h2>
		<p>DuBois gets a hospital!  Doctor’s Hospital opened its doors on West 
		Scribner Avenue in 1897, it was a 23 bed facility which was damaged by fire in 1909. The local 
		physicians then asked the Sisters of Mercy from Erie to operate the facility.  In 1910, the facility 
		was under new management. In 1912, John E. DuBois offered $10,000 and a tract of land to develop a 
		second hospital, which would be a non-profit and non-sectarian community facility. On November 2, 
		1914, the Borough of DuBois, voted to become a third class city. So, on January 1, 1915 the Borough 
		of DuBois officially became the City of DuBois.</p>
		<!--
		<h2>Expansion</h2>
		<p>On October 23, 1915, the Sisters opened a new building on Hospital 
		Avenue known as the DuBois Hospital. Mr. DuBois’ plan came to fruition and the Maple Avenue Hospital
		was built on October 8, 1918. Then in 1985, the two facilities joined together to become the entity
		the DuBois Regional Medical Center. In 1928, the American Legion Post took on a monumental task and 
		cleared a tract of land to build a new one-half mile road in the Oklahoma area of DuBois for the 
		new Airport.  Because the runway was short, only smaller commuter planes could land and take off. 
		As a result, very few planes could use the airport. It was deemed not commercially feasible, and 
		the airport was closed. </p>
		<h2>The Great Depression</h2>
		<p>Durning the Great Depression, in the 1930s, millions of Americans 
		were out of work and food. The government established the C.C.C. (Civilian Conservation Corps). 
		The Corp brought thousands of young men from the streets and paid them to work on projects for 
		the public good.  As a matter of fact, a few of those projects completed in DuBois included the 
		steps at the top of Liberty Boulevard and Mansell Stadium. On June 14, 1949, the City of DuBois and 
		the DuBois Baseball Club entered into an agreement for the club to lease a piece of land which is 
		now Showers Field.  As a result, the club received a 25-year lease, which was renewed in 1974. On 
		August 11, 1960, tragedy in the City of DuBois struck again. What was then called the “Dime Store 
		Fire” started at 3:10 a.m. and took out the Long Avenue business section. The stores destroyed 
		included: F.W. Woolworth’s, Matthew’s Book Store, J. J. Newberry, June Hess Beauty Shop and B. & J. 
		Restaurant. Flames were discovered in the basement of the B. & J. Restaurant or Newberry’s. The 
		fire companies were delayed in getting to the fire due to a train blocking the Long Avenue crossing.

		link below. 
		<h2>City Government</h2>
		<p></p>The construction of our Sewage Treatment Plant began in 1960 and 
		went into operation May 15, 1961. In 1964, the controversy was fluoridation of the public water 
		supply. Therefore, at the General Election held on November 3, 1964, the vote was overwhelming to 
		mandate in favor of having the City of DuBois Water Supply fluoridated. The City of DuBois adopted 
		its official flag on May 14, 1973. It was the standard carried by the DuBois All-Girls Drill Team 
		and was described as follows:  The John DuBois family coat of arms consisting of an emblem eagle 
		positioned in a shield outline and crested by a medieval armor helmet facing right, with the entire 
		emblem centered on a field of white amid blue lettering identifying the City of DuBois.  In the late 
		1970s, a referendum was put to vote changing the form of government for the City of DuBois from 
		Mayor – Council to Council – Manager. On May 29, 1979, the Administrative Organization Ordinance 
		was signed in to law, giving the City Manager authority over all the administrative departments of
		the City. The first City Manager was Clifford Steff who was appointed on April 26, 1982, and removed
		from office on April 1, 1984. In 1989, a new municipal building was finished at 16 W. Scribner 
		Avenue, which housed all departments with the exception of the City Garage located on 
		Parkway Drive.</p> 
		<h2>Baseball Field Updates</h2>
		<p></p>In 2012, using grant funds, a major renovation of Showers Field 
		took place: new field house, press box, bleachers, turf, concession stand, lighting, score board, 
		and parking lot. With the new renovations, Showers Field got the attention of the Small College 
		World Series, the Little League for Championships, Penn State University and the DuBois Area School 
		District. During spring and summer months, most days you will find a team playing on the field and 
		several times a year major tournaments taking place. After all the extensive renovations of Showers 
		Field, the City’s eyes turned to a softball field.  At the same time, a number of parents and 
		caregivers approached the City about a Miracle Field for challenged and handicapped individuals. 
		The City listened and designed a field that could be used by both the challenged and non-challenged 
		alike. Thus, through private donations and grants, the Challenger Field was born; currently called 
		the Denny & Rose Heindl Memorial Field. With the close proximity of the Senior Little League/Teener 
		Field in the DuBois Park, renovations for this field also worked simultaneously with the renovations
		of Heindl Field.</p> 
		<h2>Consolidation</h2>
		<p>The consolidation of the City of DuBois and Sandy Township had been 
		attempted several times in the past; but on November 2, 2021, by a small margin of votes, 
		consolidation passed. It was voted that the new entity would be called the City of DuBois and the 
		form of government would be Council – Manager. As a result, the two municipalities had one year to 
		come up with a consolidation agreement and three years to implement the plan. In 2022, renovations
		began on the East DuBois Avenue Park or “top of the boulevard”, it is fondly called. Walking paths, 
		a fountain, different tiers of walls, and cherry trees were installed.  The project was to be 
		completed in 2023.</p> -->
