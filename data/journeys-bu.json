And so it was that on Tuesday, the 6th of October 1891. Nils shook his father's hand and gave his mother one last hug. Then said 'Good Bye' to the rest of the family members present. And off he would go to start his journey. He left from Svenshult (See the link under Places) on the eastern coast of Sweden. It would have been a cool, crisp morning and Nils would have been anxious to start. For this would be a long journey. A journey of a life time. He wouldn't have a chance to see Karin. Nils would have either traveled by train or coach (stage coach). Had he traveled by train it would have been an all day excursion, arriving in G√∂teborg later that evening. Travel by coach would have been even longer."

John, being more than ten years older then Peter, had traveled to America some five or six years earlier. John settled in DuBois, Pa. Once Peter settled in, he plied his trade as a shoemaker and waited for his fianc√© to arrive. The following year his future wife Katherine (Corine Nor√©n as stated on their marriage license), arrived from Sweden. Nils and Karin applied for a marriage license in the county court house on May 25, 1892. Three days later they had a church wedding. It was in DuBois on September 1<sup>st</sup>, 1893, that their first child, Herman (my grandfather), was born. Shortly after Herman's birth, Nils and Karin decided to leave DuBois and relocate to Chicago, Illinois."
