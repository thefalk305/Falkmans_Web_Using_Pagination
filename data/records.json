Held from May to October 1933 (and extended to 1934), it showcased advancements in science and technology, promoting a vision of a brighter future during the Great Depression, and featured many Art Deco-style buildings. Key attractions included the Firestone singing color fountains, a display of King Kong, and the first sale of Krispy Kreme donuts from an automated machine."
