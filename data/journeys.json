And off he would go to start his journey. He left from Svenshult (See the link under Places) on the eastern coast of Sweden. It would have been a cool, crisp morning and Nils would have been anxious to start. For this would be a long journey. A journey of a life time. He wouldn't have a chance to see Karin. Nils would have either traveled by train or coach (stage coach). Had he traveled by train it would have been an all day excursion, arriving in Göteborg later that evening. Travel by coach would have been even longer."
