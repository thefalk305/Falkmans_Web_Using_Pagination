     <p style="text-align: justify"><b>Greetings,</b> my name is Al Falkman. I started this 
		adventure back in 1978. There were no online services at the time. All of the research 
		was done by hand. I spent months and months searching through records and micro-fiche 
		files for scraps of information. It took my wife and myself almost two (2) years just 
		to find my great-grandfather's ship manifest. But that was just the start. Then came my 
		great-grandmother's records, and after that, aunts, uncles and cousins.</p>
		<p style="text-align: justify">I hope you 
		enjoy looking at the records and pictures as much as I did while putting this site 
		together. This website was first published in 2010. The canvas didn't change much 
		for many years but, now with the help of my family, I am updating the website, adding 
		new templates and a lot of new information that has been discovered over the years. I 
		want to thank all my family for the information and support they have given.</p>

		<h1>Nils Pitt Falkman Emigrates to the U. S.</h1>

		<img alt="Photograph of Peter Nels Falkman." class="imglft"
		height="229" src="img/Peter.jpg" width="187" />

		<p style="text-align: justify">
			Nils's story starts 
		back in the mid 1800's. Records indicate that he was born on Thursday, 
		April 30<sup>th</sup> 1863. He was born in Svenshult. This would be the 
		farm that his family lived on. Which is located in the parish of 
		Hinneryd. Hinneryd lies in the county of Kronoberg. And Kronoberg is one 
		of three counties in the province of Småland. In the southern part of 
		Sweden. His parents were Johan Nilsson and Karna Persdotter. They were 
		'Sharecroppers'. Working the land for a wealthy land owner. And in 
		return, given a cottage and a parcel of land to work for themselves. 
		When Nils turned 18 or 19 he was more than likely conscripted into the 
		military. Back in the 1800's it was mandatory. Much like our 'draft' we 
		had in the United States. After his time in the military he returned 
		home and he lived with his parents on the farm. Until he took up an 
		apprenticeship in Hudiksvall. After his apprenticeship he emigration to 
		the United States.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">I have discovered that 
		Nils did had siblings, five to be exact. Three brothers and two sisters. 
		One of the girls died at an early age (6 months). This would have been 
		before Peter was born. Family planning was not heard of in the 1800's. 
		And the more children you could raise, meant more help on the farm. Or 
		the bigger your business could grow. Not to mention just propagating the 
		family name. It's only in recent times do we limit out families to one 
		or two children. As for Nils's profession. The census records have him 
		listed as a shoemaker. And it would appear that this is the 
		apprenticeship trade that he took up in Hudiksvall. At this time in 
		history the patronymic naming system was in use. The male children would 
		take on the father's first name. And add son to the beginnings or the 
		end of the name. The females would take the father's first name and add 
		'dotter' to the end of the name. Nils Pitt's name was originally Nils 
		Pitt Johansson. Taking on the father's first name (Johan) and adding 
		'son' to it. Prior to leaving for America Nils would change his name to 
		Falkman. This was a common practice in the military. There would be so 
		many Johansson's or Nilsson's in a company or regiment, that they would 
		have changed some names. Nils Johansson became Nils Falkman. And his 
		brother who was Johan Johansson, became Johan Lofgren. The records show 
		that Nils and Karin Noren would both travel to Hudiksvall (at different 
		times). And that this time would be overlapping. It appears that there, 
		in Hudiksvall, is where Nils received his formal training as a 
		shoemaker. And Karin would learn a seamstress trade. I think, this is 
		where Nils would eventually meet Karin. Maybe they lived at the same 
		boarding house. Or ate at the same restaurant. Or maybe they met in 
		church. Anyway their relationship grew. And as time went by Nils would 
		see more and more of Karin. It would appear that they had fallen in love 
		and had made a pack together. This pack would be that Nils would travel 
		to America and Karin would follow as soon as possible. (less that a year 
		later).</p>
		<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
		<h2 font size="4">The Journey</h2>
		<p style="text-align: justify">Now back in the 1800's 
		travel wasn't as easy as it is today. No planes, and the railroads were 
		just coming into existence. And also traveling a great distance wasn't 
		to be taken on lightly. Many emigrants died on their migrant trip to 
		America, Canada or Australia. And also it was rather expensive. I'm sure 
		that Nils and Corine both had to save up for their pending trip. Maybe 
		taking a year or more. Or even borrowing some of the money from family 
		members. With the promise to repay the loan when they reached America. 
		(Which we all know, had streets of gold... Ha Ha). I can almost feel 
		Nils's excitement when he finally has enough money to purchase his 
		ticket. He would have gone off to see the 'ticket agent' from whom he 
		would have purchased a <u>one-way</u>, ticket to America. The ticket 
		agent would have arranged all of the travel plans. Much like our 'travel 
		agents' of today. There would have been coach or train transportation to 
		the boat. The boat fare itself and any lodging expenses that would have 
		been incurred. And so it was that on Tuesday, the 6<sup>th</sup> of 
		October 1891. Nils shook his father's hand and gave his mother one last 
		hug. Then said 'Good Bye' to the rest of the family members present. And 
		off he would go to start his journey. He left from Svenshult (<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">See 
		the link under <u>Places</u></span>) on the eastern coast of Sweden. It 
		would have been a cool, crisp morning and Nils would have been anxious 
		to start. For this would be a long journey. A journey of a life time. He 
		wouldn't have a chance to see Karin. As she lived over 40 miles away and 
		had to attend to her family choirs. Nils would have either traveled by 
		train or coach (stage coach). Had he traveled by train it would have 
		been an all day excursion. Arriving in Göteborg later that evening (<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">See 
		Göteborg under
        </span><u><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Travel Notes</span></u>). 
		Or even the next day, had Nils traveled by coach, because it would have 
		been even a slower journey. Not arriving until the 8<sup>th</sup> of October. How 
		ever he traveled Nils did arrive in time. And boarded the ship on the 
		8th of October. And set sail for Kingston on Hull on the 9th. Nils 
		traveled on the SS Romeo. A steamship built and owned by the Wilson 
		Steamship Line. (<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">More under </span><u>
        <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Transportation</span>)</u>.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">Upon arriving in Hull, 
		Nils would have more than likely stayed on board the ship until 
		transportation was available for the trip to Liverpool (<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">See 
		Kingston on Hull, under </span><u><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
		Travel Notes</span></u>) Once transportation was available, Nils would 
		have boarded a train. Along with the other passengers headed to 
		Liverpool. And the second leg of his journey would begin. Upon arrival 
		in Liverpool, he would have headed down to the docks. And boarded the 
		RMS Britannic. Which would take him across the Atlantic and in to New 
		York City. His ship would have docked at Castle Garden. This is where 
		all of the immigrants came through prior to Ellis Island. From there he 
		would have boarded a train at Grand Central Depot. And headed to DuBois 
		Pennsylvania. Where his brother would be waiting.</p>

		<h3><font size="4"><b>Karin Noren</b></font></h3>
		<p class="imglft">
		<img alt="Photograph of Karen Falkman." height="275" src="img/Karen.jpg" width="215" /></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify"><b>Corine Noren</b> (as it 
		was spelled on some of her immigration papers). 'Katherine', as she was 
		call in America. Lived in as small centrally located eastern town named 
		Arbrä. It is located about 42 miles from Hudiksvall, the same town where 
		Nils was doing his apprenticeship.
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: justify">Katherine Noren immigrated to America in May 
		of 1892. She left her home in Arbrä and traveled to Göteborg the same as Nils. 
		From there, she traveled on the SS Norden. Which took her to Hamburg, Germany. 
		From Hamburg she traveled overland to Bremen. And it was from Bremen that she 
		boarded the SS Trave. Which took her to America. Upon her arrival in New York she 
		took a train directly to DuBois, Pennsilyania. This leads me to believe that they
		must have known one another while still in Sweden. There on the 25<sup>th</sup> of May 
		1892, she was married, to Nils.&nbsp; Her first child was born in September 
		of 1893 (Herman). Shortly after Herman's birth the family decided to move to 
		Chicago, Illinois.
        <br>
       <p style="text-align: justify">Katherine's Father was a 'self ordained minister'
		(in Sweden). And he, along with several other ministers formed a new church. 
		It was called the Swedish Covenant Church. He was also educated as a professional
		&nbsp; cabinet maker. Katherine was also employed, as a maid, at the time. It is 
		not an uncommon practice for a daughter to accompany her father on his missionary 
		circuit. I think this is what Katherine did. Taking in laundry to earn a few cents 
		and also taking care of her fathers needs (cooking and washing), as he traveled on 
		his circuit. This may also explain how she came to meet Nils Peter. He may 
		have seen her at one of the church functions. They started talking and 
		Peter told her of his forth coming trip to America. He may have even 
		asked her to accompany him on his trip. I don't know how long the two 
		had know each other before making the decision to go to America. I think 
		Katherine had a stepmother... This information was confirmed by my cousin,
		Karen, who lived with Katherine, (her grand-mother), when she was a small 
		child.
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: justify">After moving to Chicago. Her husband, Nils Peter, 
		opened up a small shoe shop. Making and selling shoes and also repairing 
		them. His first shop was located in 'downtown' Chicago. And then later 
		on he moved and opened up another shop&nbsp; farther west, on Lake 
		Street. Several years later. Nils closed the shop. And started working 
		for the Chicago and Oak Park&nbsp; Rail Road. Today called the 'C.T.A.' or 
		Rapid Transit. Where he was eventually killed in a work related 
		accident. With the insurance money Katherine purchased a home in the 
		Austin area of Chicago. This is were the children were raised and went 
		to school. Katherine lived the rest of her life in the home.
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: justify">Unfortunately my earliest memories of Katherine 
		are when she was sick and confined to bed. Her two daughters Lillian and 
		Ester remained in the home. Never marrying. Ester would take care of her 
		mother and Lillian would be the one that was out working.<br>
