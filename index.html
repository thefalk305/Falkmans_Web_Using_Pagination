     <p  style=" margin-bottom: 0;"><b>Greetings,</b> my name is Al Falkman. I started this adventure back in 1978. There were no online services at the time. All of the research was done by hand. I spent months and months searching through records and micro-fiche files for scraps of information. It took my wife and myself almost two (2) years just to find my great-grandfather's ship manifest. But that was just the start. Then came my great-grandmother's records, and after that, aunts, uncles and cousins.</p>

		<p style=" margin-bottom: 0;">I hope you enjoy looking at the records and pictures as much as I did while putting this site together. This website was first published in 2010. The canvas hasn't change much for many years, but now, with the help of my family, I am updating the website, adding new templates and a lot of new information that has been discovered over the years. I want to thank all my family for the information and support they have given.</p>

		<h1>Nils Pitt Falkman Emigrates to the U. S.</h1>

		<p > Records indicate that Nils was born on <span class="date">ðŸ“… Thursday, April 30<sup>th</sup>, 1863</span>. HHe was born in Svenshult, Sweden, on the farm where his family lived. The farm is located in the parish of Hinneryd. Hinneryd lies in the county of Kronoberg. And Kronoberg is one of three counties in the province of SmÃ¥land in the southern part of Sweden. His parents were Johan Nilsson and Karna Persdotter. They were 'Sharecroppers', working the land for a wealthy land owner. In return, they were given a cottage and a parcel of land to work for themselves. When Nils turned 18 or 19 he was more than likely conscripted into the military. Back in the 1800's it was mandatory (much like the 'draft' we had here in the United States). After his time in the military, he returned home to the family farm and lived there with his parents until he took up an apprenticeship (possibly shoemaker) in <a href="Hudiksvall, Sweden.html" target="_blank">Hudiksvall</a>. After his apprenticeship he emigrated to the United States.</p>

    <p >My research has revealed that Nils had siblingsâ€”five to be exact. There were three brothers and two sisters. One of the girls died at an early age (6 months). This would have been before Peter was born. Family planning was not heard of in the 1800's and the more children you could raise meant, the more help you had on the farm. (Or, the bigger your business could grow.) Not to mention just propagating the family name. (It's only in recent times do we limit our families to one or two children.) As for Nils's profession, the census records have him listed as a shoemaker. It would appear that this is the apprenticeship trade that he took up in Hudiksvall. At this time in history the patronymic naming system was in use in Sweden. The male children would take on the father's first name and add son to the end of the name. The female children would take the father's first name and add 'dotter' to the end of the name. Nils Pitt's name was originally Nils Pitt Johansson (taking on the father's first name (Johan) and adding 'son' to it). Prior to leaving for America Nils would change his name to Falkman. This was a common practice in the military. There were so many Johansson's or Nilsson's in a company or regiment that they would have changed some names. Nils Johansson became Nils Falkman. His brother, Johan Johansson, became Johan Lofgren.</p>
		
		<p>The records show that Nils (and Karin Noren, my great-great grandmother), would both have traveled to Hudiksvall at different times, although the time that they were there did overlap. It appears it is there, in Hudiksvall, that Nils received his formal training as a shoemaker. Karin would learn the seamstress trade. I think this is where Nils would eventually meet Karin. Maybe they lived at the same boarding house. Or perhaps they ate at the same restaurant. Or, they might have met in church. At any rate, their relationship grew, and, as time went by, Nils would see more and more of Karin. It would appear that they had fallen in love and had made a pact between them; a pact that Nils would travel to America and Karin would follow as soon as possible. (Karin would travel to America less than a year later.)</p>

		<h2 font size="4">The Journey</h2>
		<p >Now, as the 1800's were just coming into existence, traveling a great distance wasn't to be taken on lightly. Many emigrants died on their trip to America, Canada or Australia. It was rather expensive. I'm sure that Nils and Corine both had to save up for their pending trips, perhaps taking a year or more. Or perhaps they borrowed some of the money from family members with the promise to repay the loan when they reached America (which we all know had streets paved with gold... Ha Ha). I can almost feel Nils's excitement when he finally has enough money to purchase his ticket. He would have gone off to see the 'ticket agent' from whom he would have purchased a <u>one-way</u> ticket to America. The ticket agent would have arranged all of the travel plans, much like our 'travel agents' of today. There would have been coach or train transportation to the boat. The boat fare itself and any lodging expenses would have been incurred. And so it was that on Tuesday, the 6<sup>th</sup> of October 1891, Nils shook his father's hand and gave his mother one last hug. Then said 'Good Bye' to the rest of the family members present, and off he would go to start his journey. He left from Svenshult on the eastern coast of Sweden. It would have been a cool, crisp morning and Nils would have been anxious to start, for this would be a long journey, a journey of a life time. He wouldn't have had a chance to see Karin as she lived over 40 miles away and had to attend to her family chores. Nils would have either traveled by train or coach (stage coach). Had he traveled by train it would have been an all day excursion, arriving in <a href="GÃ¶teborg.html" target="_blank">GÃ¶teborg</a> later that evening, or, even the next day had Nils traveled by coach because it would have been even a slower journey, not arriving until the 8<sup>th</sup> of October. However he traveled, Nils did arrive in time and boarded the ship on the 8th of October. He set sail for <a href="Kingston on Hull, England.html" target="_blank">Kingston on Hull</a> on the 9th upon the <a href="S S Romeo.html" target="_blank">S S Romeo</a>, a steamship built and owned by the Wilson Steamship Line.</p>

		<p >Upon arriving in Hull, Nils would, more than likely, have stayed on board ship until transportation for the trip to <a href="Liverpool, England.html" target="_blank">Liverpool</a> was available. Once transportation to Liverpool was available, Nils would have boarded a train along with the other passengers heading to Liverpool. Here, the second leg of his journey would begin <span class="question">(where's here?)</span> . Upon arrival in Liverpool, he would have headed down to the docks. On the 14<sup>th</sup> of October, he boarded the <a href="H M S Britannic.html" target="_blank">RMS Britannic</a>, the ship that would take him across the Atlantic and into New York City on October 23, 1889. His ship would have docked at <span class="hover-trigger" >Castle Garden<img class="hover-image" src="images/castle-garden.jpg" alt="Castle Garden"></span>. (Castle Garden served as a reception hall and temporary home of nine million immigrants from when it was opened on Aug 1, 1855 until it was closed down on April 18, 1890. From then on the Immigration Processing Centers for New York were at the <span class="hover-trigger" > Barge office<img class="hover-image" src="images/bargeoffice.jpg" alt="Castle Garden"></span> and <span class="hover-trigger" > Ellis Island.<img class="hover-image" src="images/Ellis-Island.jpg" alt="Castle Garden"></span>.) From Castle Garden, Nils would have boarded a train at Grand Central Depot and headed to <a href="DuBois, Pennsylvania.html">DuBois, Pennsylvania</a> where his brother would be waiting.</p>

		<p ><b>Corine Noren</b> (as it was spelled on some of her immigration papers), 'Katherine', as she was called in America, lived in the small town of <a href="ArbrÃ¥, Sweden.html" >ArbrÃ¥</a> ,centrally located near the eastern coast os Sweden. It is located about 42 miles south-west of <a href="Hudiksvall, Sweden.html" >Hudiksvall</a>, the same town where Nils was doing his apprenticeship.</p>

	
		<p >Katherine Noren arrived in the United States on <span class="date">ðŸ“… Friday, May 20<sup>th</sup>, 1892</span>. She was 24 years old. She left her home in ArbrÃ¥ and traveled to GÃ¶teborg, as Nils did. From there, she traveled on the <a href="S S Norden.html">S.S. Norden</a> which took her to Hamburg, Germany. From <a href="Hamburg, Germany.html">Hamburg, Germany</a>, she traveled overland to <a href="Bremen, Germany.html">Bremen</a>. It was from Bremen that she boarded the <a href="S S Trave.html" target="_blank">SS Trave</a>, which took her to New York City. Upon her arrival in New York (Ellis Island), she took a train directly to DuBois, Pennsylvania. (This leads me to believe that they must have known one another while still in Sweden.) There, in DuBois, on the 25<sup>th</sup> of May 1892, she was married to Nils. Her first child (Herman) was born in September of 1893. Shortly after Herman's birth, the family decided to move to <a href="Chicago, Illinois.html" target="_blank">Chicago, Illinois</a>.
		<br>
		<p>Katherine's Father was a 'self ordained minister' (in Sweden). He, along with several other ministers formed a new church. It was called the Swedish Covenant Church. He was also educated as a professional cabinet maker. Katherine was also employed, as a maid, at that time. It is not an uncommon practice for a daughter to accompany her father on his missionary circuit. I think this is what Katherine did. Taking in laundry to earn a few cents and also taking care of her fathers needs (cooking and washing), as he traveled on his circuit. This may also explain how she came to meet Nils Peter. He may have seen her at one of the church functions. They started talking and Peter told her of his forth coming trip to America. He may have even asked her to accompany him on his trip. I don't know how long the two had know each other before making the decision to go to America. I think Katherine had a stepmother. This information was confirmed by my cousin, Karen, who lived with Katherine, (her grand-mother), when she was a small child.</p>

		<p >After moving to Chicago, her husband, Nils Peter, opened up a small shoe shop making and selling shoes and also repairing them. His first shop was located in 'downtown' Chicago. Later on, he moved and opened up another shop farther west, on Lake Street. Several years later, Nils closed the shop and started working for the Chicago and Oak Park Rail Road, (today called the 'C.T.A.' or Rapid Transit.), where he was eventually killed in a work related accident (on the 26<sup>th</sup> of November, 1918). With the insurance money, Katherine purchased a home in the Austin area of Chicago. This is were her children were raised and went to school. Katherine lived the rest of her life in that home.

		<p >Unfortunately, my earliest memories of Katherine are when she was sick and confined to bed. Her two daughters, Lillian and Ester, remained in the home, never marrying. Ester would take care of her mother while Lillian would be the one that was out working.</p>
