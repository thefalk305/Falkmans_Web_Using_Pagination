    Welcome to Ogdensburg New Jersey. Above you will see the downtown area of Ogdensburg, this photo was taken 
    around the turn of the century. This is yet another part of the family tree. It is here where the Alexander family, 
    Frank and Adolfina, decided to set roots after escaping from Russian-held Poland. It is here where Helen Alexander 
    is born. Little did she know that she was destined to meet Allen Falkman Sr. (Nil's grandson). </p>

    <p> From the welcoming sign to the old historic Sterling Zinc Mine, this is Ogdensburg, New Jersey. This small borough  is only 2.25 miles square. But there are a lot of activities in this area, whether it be the local diners (restaurants to the rest of us), the Lapidary Museum, or the quiet, peaceful surroundings. Located not far from big cities like Jersey City or New York, Ogdensburg is situated between the Kittatinny Mountains and the Piedmont Plateau. With a population of just over 2,200, it isn't the hustling and bustling town you might expect. Rather, it's a laid-back community with some interesting things to do and see. This is the town where my mother, Helen Alexander, grew up and went to school. Born in 1921 in Hackettstown (the closest hospital), she would have attended elementary school in Ogdensburg, but had to travel to Franklin for high school. Helen was the youngest of three children. Her brother, Frank, was five years her senior, followed by her sister Violet, who was three years older. After finishing high school, Helen likely attended nurse's training at a local hospital. She later joined the Cadet Nurse Corps and received additional training at Camp Blanding Station Hospital near Starke, Florida. After a four-week course, she was transferred to Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, where she met Allen Falkman (my dad). And as they say, "The rest is history". Not long after arriving in Algiers, Helen discovered she was pregnant with me! She was sent back to the U.S., ending her military career. Back home, she moved in with her in-laws, Herman and Mary Falkman, in Chicago.

    <p>A brief history of Ogdensburg --- In the 1920s, Ogdensburg was a small but industrious mining town nestled in Sussex County, with its identity deeply tied to the Sterling Hill Mine and the New Jersey Zinc Company. </p>
    <p>üèîÔ∏è Industrial Backbone
    - The Sterling Hill Mine, active from 1848 to 1986, was a major source of zinc and other minerals. By 1920, it had been consolidated under the New Jersey Zinc Company, which dominated local employment and shaped the town‚Äôs infrastructure.
    - The Ogden Mine Railroad, opened in 1868, had long connected Ogdensburg to broader markets, facilitating ore transport and contributing to the town‚Äôs growth.</p>
    <p>üèòÔ∏è Community & Culture
    - Ogdensburg‚Äôs layout was largely established by the early 1900s, with Main Street and surrounding hamlets like Sterling Hill and Summerville forming the core of the community.
    - The town featured several notable buildings by this time: the Patrick Madden Store, Madden Opera House, Dolan‚Äôs Garage, and Lyon House Hotel, which had once hosted Thomas Edison during his mining ventures nearby.
    - A section near the Wallkill River, known as Sodom, had seceded from Sparta and developed its own identity within Ogdensburg.</p>
    <p>üó∫Ô∏è Visual Records
    - Detailed Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps from 1920 provide a snapshot of Ogdensburg‚Äôs streets, buildings, and industrial sites. These maps were used by insurance companies and city planners and are now valuable resources for historians and genealogists.</p>
