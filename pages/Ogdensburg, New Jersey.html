		<p>Ogdensburg, New Jersey is yet another part of the family tree. It is here were Helen Katherine Alexander (my mother) is born, destined to meet Allen Falkman Sr. (Nil's grandson) </p>

    <p>In the 1920s, Ogdensburg was a small but industrious mining town nestled in Sussex County, with its identity deeply tied to the Sterling Hill Mine and the New Jersey Zinc Company. </p>
    <p>🏔️ Industrial Backbone
    - The Sterling Hill Mine, active from 1848 to 1986, was a major source of zinc and other minerals. By 1920, it had been consolidated under the New Jersey Zinc Company, which dominated local employment and shaped the town’s infrastructure.
    - The Ogden Mine Railroad, opened in 1868, had long connected Ogdensburg to broader markets, facilitating ore transport and contributing to the town’s growth.</p>
    <p>🏘️ Community & Culture
    - Ogdensburg’s layout was largely established by the early 1900s, with Main Street and surrounding hamlets like Sterling Hill and Summerville forming the core of the community.
    - The town featured several notable buildings by this time: the Patrick Madden Store, Madden Opera House, Dolan’s Garage, and Lyon House Hotel, which had once hosted Thomas Edison during his mining ventures nearby.
    - A section near the Wallkill River, known as Sodom, had seceded from Sparta and developed its own identity within Ogdensburg.</p>
    <p>🗺️ Visual Records
    - Detailed Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps from 1920 provide a snapshot of Ogdensburg’s streets, buildings, and industrial sites. These maps were used by insurance companies and city planners and are now valuable resources for historians and genealogists.</p>
