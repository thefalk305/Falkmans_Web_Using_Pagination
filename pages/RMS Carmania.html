		<p>The 19,566 GRT (Gross Registered Ton) "Carmania" (completed November 1905) was the sister ship of the 19,594 GRT "Caronia" (completed February 1905), yet they actually ended up having completely different machinery installed, in addition the “Carmania” was a triple screw liner, and the "Caronia" a twin screw liner. The R.M.S. Carmania was powered by the then innovative Parson's steam turbine engines, which offered higher speeds, simpler maintenance and best of all, lower operational costs. Thus she was effectively the test ship for operating a turbine engine on a large passenger liner, whilst her sister, the R.M.S. Caronia was operated by the more traditional quadruple-expansion steam engines. These very different systems were installed purposely as it was done to test the effectiveness of these two systems, and which would be the most effective for the future. Another feature that differentiated the two sister ships was that "Carmania" had two tall forward deck ventilator cowls, which the "Caronia" did not have. But there was something else about these two fine sister ships, for at the time they where the largest and fastest liners in the Cunard fleet. In 1923 Cunard had her refitted as a cabin class ship, with her total accommodation reduced from 2,650 berths to 1,440. </p>

		<p >In 1924, Sir Arthur H. Rostron (KBE, RD) was the captain of the RMS Carmania. Rostron won wide praise for his energetic efforts to reach the Titanic before she sank,and his efficient preparations for and conduct of the rescue of the survivors. He was awarded a Congressional Gold Medal by the United States Congress, and in 1926, he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire. He rose to become the Commodore of the Cunard fleet and retired in 1931.
		</p>

		<p >It was on this ship that Adolfina Chytra (Ida we called her), crossed the Atlantic Ocean and came to America. She was just 17 at the time. When she left her native home of Leszczyna, Zlotoryja, Poland. Leszczyna is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Złotoryja, within Złotoryja County, Lower Silesian Voivodeship, in south-western Poland. It lies approximately 8 km (5 mi) south-east of Złotoryja and 74 km (46 mi) west of the regional capital Wrocław.
		</p>

		<p >Adolfina's ship departed Liverpool, England on the 24<sup>th</sup> of January, 1914. And arrived in America (New York City) some 8 days later. From New York, Ida traveled to New Jersey where she had relatives. While staying with her relatives, Ida met Frank Alexander. They became aquatinted. And on the 21<sup>th</sup> of September Frank and Ida were married. The marriage ceremony to place at Our Lady of Solace in Allamuchy, New Jersey.
